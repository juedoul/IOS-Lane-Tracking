Title: Real Time Lane Detection and Tracking

members: Yujun Wang(Andrew ID: yujunwan) Juedou Liu(Andrew ID: juedoul)
      
Summary:
In this project we plan to use Hough Transform to detecting the Lane in realtime based on video captured from the camera of iPad air2.

Background:
take advantage of ...to accelerate the computing speed

The challege:
Traditional method dealing with image to detect lane is quite slow in PC, we are trying to implement this on a mobile device at a relative fast speed.

Goals & Deliverables:
Plan to do:

Criteria: 
      What would be a success
      level: A
             B
             C
      How realistic?
      
Schedule:
      First week (Nov.9-Nov.15): some coding stuff
      Second week (Nov.16-Nov.22): some coding stuff and prepare for Project CheckPoint Write-Up
      Third week (Nov.23-Nov.29): some coding stuff and testing
      Fourth week (Nov.30-Dec.6): testing and prepare for final presentation and Final Write-Up
